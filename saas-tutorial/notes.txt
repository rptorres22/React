Front End (client):
========================================================
With all of this said and done, you should now have a working front end
authentication system that will tie in perfectly with your back end. To test
this, run npm start in your console. Your Webpack should start building, and
once it says your bundle is valid, you can head to
http://localhost:8080/register to set up a new account. You can also try going
to http://localhost:8080/login to login once you've set an account up.




========================================================
Back End (server):
========================================================
Now you can test out your new API endpoints by creating a new conversation.

In Postman, you will need to login by sending a POST request to
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login with your email and password. Once you get
a JWT response, copy that and put it in your Authorization headers.
(Instructions for this can be found in this tutorial toward the bottom). Change
the body of the request to composedMessage: Test message here! then change your
URL to /api/chat/new/idOfUser, but enter the ID of one of the users saved in
your database. Hit send and you should get a success message.

Feel free to also test your GET routes on all conversations (/api/chat) and then
on the individual conversation (/api/chat/idOfConversation)you just created. You
can also add a reply with your other POST route (/api/chat/idOfConversation).
